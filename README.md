# Home Panels
Beautiful local home control from your wall using any tablet backed by Homey Pro.

## On your wall
Home Panels are screens on your wall allowing home control and monitoring. A panel can be your old iPad, 
an Android tablet, Sonoff NSPanel Pro, or anything capable of displaying a website. If your panel has a
touchscreen, it can be used for home control. If not, it can still be used for displaying relevant
information.

## What makes it "local"?
The Home Panel Central App backs your panels. This app runs on your Homey Pro device, and your
screens communicate with it over your local network. There is not a single request leaving your network. This
approach makes it safe to use and resistant to internet service outages.

## Why Homey Pro?
Homey Pro is about independent local smart homes. Home Panels is built around the same core values: 
Local, safe, and free from subscriptions. So Homey Pro is the perfect partner for powering the Home Panels
ecosystem.
